This is Smart Traffic Lights project that aimed timing of traffic lights dynamically according to the feed of cameras that can see the cars on the crossroad.
First part of the project is detection and counting of the cars in a video. We tried two methods for this part: image processing and a deep learning model. We used OpenCV on Python for image processing and YOLOv3 as a deep learning model.
